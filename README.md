### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a a software engineer. Iâ€™m the CTO at [Giant](https://www.giantmade.com/), an agency which works to make the world a better place with digital.

Iâ€™ve spent most of my career working with Python, primarily Django. I also have a deep understanding of devops; the technology, practices and the more difficult human elements. At work, I enjoy helping people develop in their early careers through coaching and mentoring; this is by far the most rewarding thing I do.

Iâ€™m a fan of minimalism in technology and I enjoy technology history. Iâ€™m also very interested in internet infrastructure and efficiency.
